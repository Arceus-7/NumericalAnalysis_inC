# Numerical Analysis in C

C implementations of numerical methods covered in Numerical Analysis.

## Disclaimer

This repository is created for my personal use and coursework. The implementations are meant for me to keep a tab of the things being done in class and for future reference. If you choose to use any of this code, you do so entirely at your own risk, because I am a fucking retard so dont trust my code. Thank you

## How to compile and run

You need a C compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC). Each file is a standalone program.

To compile a single file:

```
gcc -o 03_newton_forward 03_newton_forward.c -lm
```

To run it:

```
./03_newton_forward
```

On Windows without a Unix-like shell:

```
03_newton_forward.exe
```

To compile everything at once (PowerShell):

```powershell
Get-ChildItem *.c | ForEach-Object { gcc -o ($_.BaseName + ".exe") $_.FullName -lm }
```

To compile everything at once (Bash):

```bash
for f in *.c; do gcc -o "${f%.c}" "$f" -lm; done
```

All programs are interactive and will prompt you for input.
